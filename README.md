# React Fundamentals

ðŸš§ **Under Construction** ðŸš§

This project is currently in development, and I'm actively working on it.

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a highly scalable web application built using React, Vite, TypeScript, and Jest. It covers all the front-end fundamentals.

#### React Basics

- [x] Use props to pass data to child components.
- [ ] Manage component state using useState and useEffect hooks.

#### Routing:

- [ ] Implement client-side routing using React Router or a similar library.
- [ ] Set up routes for different pages like home, product listings, product details, cart, and checkout.

#### State Management:

- [ ] Manage global application state using tools like Redux, Mobx, or React's Context API.
- [ ] Handle state for features like user authentication, shopping cart, and product selection.

#### User Authentication:

- [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality.
- [ ] Secure routes and data based on user authentication.
- [ ] Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

#### Data Fetching:

- [ ] Fetch data from an API (e.g., RESTful or GraphQL) to populate product listings.
- [ ] Use Axios, Fetch API, or GraphQL libraries for data retrieval.

#### Product Listings:

- [ ] Display a grid or list of products with images, titles, prices, and descriptions.
- [ ] Implement filters and sorting options for product listings.

#### Product Details:

- [ ] Create a product detail page with additional information about a selected product.
- [ ] Allow users to add items to the cart from this page.

#### Shopping Cart:

- [ ] Develop a shopping cart component to display added products.
- [ ] Implement functionality to add, remove, and update quantities of items.
- [ ] Calculate and display the total price.

#### Checkout:

- [ ] Design and implement a checkout process.
- [ ] Collect shipping and payment information.
- [ ] Validate and process orders.

#### Forms and Validation:

- [ ] Create forms for user registration, login, and checkout.
- [ ] Implement form validation and error handling.

#### Styling:

- [ ] Use CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or CSS preprocessors (e.g., SCSS) for styling.
- [ ] Ensure a responsive design for various screen sizes and devices.

#### Third-Party Libraries:

- [ ] Integrate third-party libraries for features like image carousels, payment processing, or social sharing.

#### Error Handling:

- [ ] Handle errors gracefully and provide feedback to users.
- [ ] Implement error boundaries to prevent crashes.

#### Performance Optimization:

- [ ] Optimize application performance by lazy loading components, using memoization, and minimizing re-renders.

#### Testing:

- [ ] Write unit tests and integration tests for your components and functionality.
- [ ] Use testing libraries like Jest and testing utilities like React Testing Library.

#### Deployment:

- [ ] Choose a hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Netlify) and deploy your application.
- [ ] Configure build and deployment scripts.

#### Security:

- [ ] Implement security best practices, such as sanitizing user input, protecting against XSS and CSRF attacks, and securing APIs.

#### Accessibility:

- [ ] Ensure your application is accessible to all users by following web accessibility guidelines (WCAG).

#### Analytics and Monitoring:

- [ ] Integrate analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to track user behavior.
- [ ] Set up error tracking and monitoring using tools like Sentry.

#### Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n):

- [ ] Support multiple languages and regions by implementing i18n and l10n.

#### Documentation:

- [ ] Document your code, components, and project structure for future maintainability.

#### Version Control:

- [ ] Use Git for version control and collaborate with a team if applicable.

#### Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD):

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

#### Scalability and Future Considerations:

- [ ] Plan for scalability as your e-commerce site grows.
- [ ] Consider adding features like reviews, wishlists, and product recommendations.

#### Legal and Compliance:

- [ ] Ensure your application complies with legal requirements, such as GDPR for data protection and PCI DSS for payment processing.

#### Performance Monitoring:

- [ ] Monitor application performance using tools like New Relic or performance profiling in Chrome DevTools.

#### User Experience (UX):

- [ ] Continuously improve the UX based on user feedback and usability testing.

#### SEO Optimization:

- [ ] Implement on-page SEO techniques to improve search engine rankings.

#### Feedback and Support:

- [ ] Provide ways for users to contact support or leave feedback.
